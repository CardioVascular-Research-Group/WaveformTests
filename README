Instructions:

Currently, Firefox 28, Internet Explorer 9, and Chrome 34.0.1846.116 m have been tested.  Future versions of these tests will include Opera and Safari.

If using Firefox or Safari, enter the appropriate text in the "browser" field of the global_properties.config file and proceed to the Running CVRG_Tests stage.

If using a different browser, assuming that you have the browser installed, then follow these instructions first:

-  Download the appropriate Selenium Driver for the browser if needed, unzip it to a location of your choice

Internet Explorer:  http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
Chrome:  http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

The drivers for Opera and Safari come built-in and do not require additional downloads.

-  In the global_properties.config file, enter the full path where the executable file was placed the "browserdriver" field (or the browser executable in the case of Opera)

-  Change the "browser" field to the appropriate selection (the comments give the currently supported choices, which must be entered as stated)

Note:  If using Opera, the Opera Driver only works with version 12.16 and below.  Later versions do not work as they use a different engine.

Also note that Safari will only run on OSX.  Future implementations of Selenium may expand that to Windows.


Running CVRG_Tests:

This can either be compiled as an executable jar or run as a project within eclipse.

First, acquire the Selenium libraries and their dependencies from the CVRG_Tests-dependencies folder in Dropbox.  Copy the CVRG_Tests-dependencies folder into the projects-dependencies folder in liferay

Copy the config files located in that same directory into the src/testconfig folder in the project source code.  Be sure to fill in the login credentials
for the login accounts in the global_properties.config file before building the jar.

If running as a standalone executable:

1)  Run the ant script to build the executable jar.  By default it will place the jar in /opt/liferay/testing

2)  At the command line, type:

java -jar WaveformTests.jar <LOGIN | WAVEFORM | CEP | ALL> <host> <username> <password> <desired_logfile_location>

Note:  The ant script copies over a default config file into the /opt/liferay/testing folder that is ready to use.


If running from within Eclipse:  

1)  Add the Selenium libraries to the build path

2)  Go to Run -> Run Configurations

3)  Go to the Arguments tab

4)  Under the "Program Arguments" field, enter the value for each command line argument in the order presented in Step 3 of 
	running this project as a standalone jar.  Each argument must be on a separate line.
	
5)  Click Apply, and then click Run.

After the initial configuration is set up, all that is required is to run the program through Eclipse.  This also allows for 
running in debug mode as well.  To change the command line arguments simply return to the Run Configurations screen and follow the steps
above.

Note:  If the logfile location is in the same place as an existing logfile, it will attempt to append to that logfile rather than override and create a new one.

In addition, on Windows, use a word processor or text editor other than Notepad for best results
